# Seek First to Understand

Apply Covey's Habit 5 framework to diagnose listening levels, shift from autobiographical responses to empathic understanding, and earn the right to be understood.

---

## When to Use

- Communication has broken down between parties
- User feels unheard or cannot get others to listen
- Conflict where both sides are talking past each other
- User asks "They won't listen to me", "We talk past each other", or "Help me communicate better"
- Preparing for a difficult conversation

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The communication challenge |
| parties | Yes | Who is involved |
| current_state | Yes | What's happening now in the communication |
| desired_outcome | No | What the user wants to achieve |

## Covey's Seek First to Understand Framework

"Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply."

This is the communication habit of the 7 Habits. Empathic listening means entering another person's frame of reference to understand how they see and feel about the world. It's not about agreeing; it's about understanding.

### The Five Levels of Listening

| Level | Name | Description | Quality |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Ignoring** | Not listening at all; distracted | Poor |
| 2 | **Pretending** | Appearing to listen ("uh-huh, yeah") while thinking of other things | Poor |
| 3 | **Selective** | Hearing only parts that interest you or confirm your views | Partial |
| 4 | **Attentive** | Paying full attention to words, but from your own frame of reference | Good |
| 5 | **Empathic** | Listening to understand their meaning, feelings, and frame of reference | Highest |

### The Autobiographical Responses (What NOT to Do)

When people share, we typically respond autobiographically — filtering their experience through our own:

| Response | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Evaluate** | Judge, agree or disagree | "I think you're overreacting" |
| **Probe** | Ask questions from our frame | "But why did you do that?" |
| **Advise** | Give solutions based on our experience | "Here's what you should do..." |
| **Interpret** | Explain their motives based on our perspective | "The reason you feel that way is..." |

These responses are natural but they block empathic listening. They make the conversation about US, not them.

### Psychological Air

"When you show deep empathy toward others, their defensive energy goes down, and positive energy replaces it."

People need to feel understood before they can be open to understanding you. This is "psychological air" — until they have it, they cannot focus on anything else.

### The Core Principle

"Seek first to understand, then to be understood."

You earn the right to be heard by first truly hearing.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Diagnose Your Current Level
Which level are you typically operating at in this relationship?
- Are you truly listening or waiting to reply?
- Are you filtering through your own experience?
- Do you respond autobiographically?

### Step 2: Shift Your Intent
Change from "How do I get them to understand me?" to "How can I understand them?"
- Suspend your agenda temporarily
- Become genuinely curious about their world
- Set aside your solutions

### Step 3: Reflect Content
Start by paraphrasing what they said:
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "Let me make sure I understand — you're saying..."
- Check for accuracy, not agreement

### Step 4: Reflect Feeling
Go beyond words to the emotion underneath:
- "You're feeling frustrated because..."
- "It sounds like you're worried about..."
- "That must have felt disappointing when..."

### Step 5: Reflect Content + Feeling
Combine both for full empathic response:
- "You're feeling [emotion] because [content/reason]"
- Wait for them to confirm: "Yes, exactly!"
- When they feel fully understood, they become open to hearing you

### Step 6: Then Seek to Be Understood
Only after they feel understood should you share your perspective:
- "Now that I understand where you're coming from, can I share how I see it?"
- Present your view clearly but not defensively
- Seek mutual understanding, not victory

## Output Format

```markdown
## Seek First to Understand Assessment

### The Situation
**Parties:** [Who is involved]
**Current State:** [What's happening]
**Breakdown Pattern:** [How communication is failing]

### Listening Level Diagnosis

**Your current level:** [1-5]
**Evidence:** [Why this level]

**Their current level:** [1-5]
**Evidence:** [Why this level]

**The pattern:** [How the levels interact to create breakdown]

### Autobiographical Response Check

Are you responding autobiographically?
| Response Type | Example from This Situation |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Evaluating | [If applicable] |
| Probing | [If applicable] |
| Advising | [If applicable] |
| Interpreting | [If applicable] |

### Shifting to Empathic Listening

**What you need to understand about their perspective:**
- [What might they be feeling?]
- [What's important to them that you might be missing?]
- [What's the story they're telling themselves?]

**Questions to understand (not probe):**
- [Genuine curiosity question]
- [Understanding-seeking question]

### The Empathic Response

**Step 1 — Reflect Content:**
"So what you're saying is [paraphrase their position]..."

**Step 2 — Reflect Feeling:**
"And you're feeling [emotion] about this because [reason]..."

**Step 3 — Combined Response:**
"You feel [emotion] because [situation/content]. Is that right?"

**Wait for:** "Yes, exactly!" or their correction

### Then Seek to Be Understood

**Only after they feel heard:**
"Now that I understand where you're coming from, can I share my perspective?"

**Your message (clear, not defensive):**
"[What you need them to understand]"

### The New Pattern

**Instead of:** [Old pattern of communication]
**Try:** [New empathic pattern]

### The Covey Principle

"[Relevant quote about empathic listening]"
```

## Constraints

- Empathic listening is NOT agreement — you can understand without agreeing
- You cannot fake empathy — if you're just using technique, they'll feel it
- Reflecting feelings incorrectly is fine — they'll correct you, which deepens understanding
- This takes longer initially but saves time in the long run
- If YOU need to be understood first, acknowledge it: "I need you to hear me, then I'll listen to you"
- Some people are not ready to be understood — don't force it

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My business partner and I keep having the same argument. He thinks I'm being too cautious about expansion, and I think he's being reckless. We've discussed it a dozen times and neither of us budges. I feel like he doesn't hear me."

**Output:**

## Seek First to Understand Assessment

### The Situation
**Parties:** You and your business partner
**Current State:** Repetitive argument about expansion; neither feels heard
**Breakdown Pattern:** Both listening at Level 3-4 (selective/attentive from own frame), responding autobiographically

### Listening Level Diagnosis

**Your current level:** Level 4 (Attentive)
**Evidence:** You're hearing his words ("he thinks I'm being too cautious") but filtering through your frame ("I think he's being reckless"). You understand his position but not his world.

**Their current level:** Level 4 (Attentive)
**Evidence:** Same pattern — he hears "cautious" but interprets it through his frame as "obstacle to growth."

**The pattern:** Two people at Level 4 can have the same conversation forever. Both are listening but neither is entering the other's frame of reference. Each discussion just reinforces each position.

### Autobiographical Response Check

Are you responding autobiographically?
| Response Type | Example from This Situation |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Evaluating** | "He's being reckless" (judging his position) |
| **Probing** | "Have you thought about what happens if it fails?" (questions from your frame) |
| **Advising** | "We should slow down and analyze more" (your solution) |
| **Interpreting** | "He just wants to grow for ego" (explaining his motives from your perspective) |

You're likely doing all four. And so is he.

### Shifting to Empathic Listening

**What you need to understand about his perspective:**
- What does expansion MEAN to him? (Security? Opportunity? Validation?)
- What risk does he see in NOT expanding? (You've focused on risk of expanding)
- What story is he telling himself about your caution? (Does he feel blocked? Unsupported?)
- What's exciting him about this that you might be dismissing?

**Questions to understand (not probe):**
- "Help me understand what you see in this opportunity. What gets you excited about it?"
- "What concerns you most about staying where we are?"
- "When I raise concerns, what does that feel like for you?"

These are different from: "Have you thought about the risks?" (That's probing from your frame.)

### The Empathic Response

In your next conversation, start here:

**Step 1 — Reflect Content:**
"So what you're saying is that you see this expansion as a significant opportunity, and you feel like the window might not stay open forever. You think we're in a strong position to take this risk now."

**Step 2 — Reflect Feeling:**
"And you're feeling frustrated because every time you bring up the opportunity, I raise concerns, which feels like I'm being an obstacle rather than a partner."

**Step 3 — Combined Response:**
"You feel frustrated and maybe a bit unsupported because you see a real opportunity and you feel like I keep focusing on what could go wrong instead of what could go right. Is that accurate?"

**Wait for:** His response. If he says "Yes, exactly!" — you've given him psychological air. If he corrects you, that's good too — you're getting closer to understanding.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT immediately follow with "But here's why you're wrong." That erases the empathy. Let him feel understood. Ask follow-up questions. "Tell me more about what you're seeing."

### Then Seek to Be Understood

**Only after he feels heard (might take more than one conversation):**
"I think I understand now why this matters so much to you. Can I share what's going on for me?"

**Your message (clear, not defensive):**
"When I raise concerns, I'm not trying to block you. I'm trying to make sure we protect what we've built. What looks like caution to you feels like responsibility to me. I want to find a way forward that lets us pursue the opportunity while managing the downside. Can we work on that together?"

### The New Pattern

**Instead of:**
"You're being reckless" / "You're being too cautious"
(Position vs. Position — infinite loop)

**Try:**
"Help me understand what you're seeing" --> "Let me make sure I understand — you feel..." --> "Now that I understand, here's what I'm experiencing..."
(Understanding --> Understanding --> Problem-solving together)

### The Third Alternative

If you both feel genuinely understood, you become open to a third alternative:
- Not "your cautious way" or "his aggressive way"
- But a new way neither of you has thought of yet
- This only emerges after both feel heard

### The Covey Principle

"The deepest need of the human heart is to be understood. Once that need is met, the personal focus can turn to problem-solving."

You've been trying to solve the problem before meeting the need. That's why you keep having the same argument. Meet the need first. The problem will become easier to solve.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Stephen Covey** expert persona. It implements Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood. It often follows emotional-bank-account (building trust) and precedes win-win-agreement (negotiating solutions) and synergy-creation (finding third alternatives). Without empathic listening, Win-Win degenerates into compromise and synergy never emerges.

**Note:** This skill complements the Rogers-based empathic-listening skill. Covey explicitly built on Rogers' work; this skill emphasizes the communication sequence (understand FIRST, then be understood) and the diagnosis of autobiographical responses.
